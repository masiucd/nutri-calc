						CalorieTrack was created with a simple yet powerful mission: to help
						people make informed nutritional choices through accurate,
						science-based calorie tracking.

						The Science
					</H4>
					<P>
						Our calorie calculator uses the Mifflin-St Jeor equation, widely
						recognized as the most accurate formula for estimating Basal
						Metabolic Rate (BMR)
					</P>
					<P>
						We then apply activity multipliers based on your lifestyle to
						determine your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE). This gives you
						a precise starting point for your nutritional planning, whether your
						goal is weight loss, maintenance, or muscle gain.
					</P>
